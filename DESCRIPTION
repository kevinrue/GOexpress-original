Description: The package contains methods to visualise gene expression levels
  of genes from a microarray or RNA-seq experiment and offers a clustering
  analysis to identify GO terms enriched in genes with
  expression levels best clustering predefined groups of samples.
  The BioMart database is used to obtain annotation of the genes present
  in the expression dataset. A random forest approach is used to
  evaluated the ability of each gene to cluster samples according to the 
  factor under scrutiny. Finally, GO terms are scored by averaging the power
  of their respective gene sets to cluster the samples. An ANOVA approach is
  also available as an alternative statistical framework.
