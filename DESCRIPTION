Description: The package contains functions to perform a clustering analysis
  and subsequently visualise the results. It combines gene expression data
  and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to identify GO terms enriched in genes with
  expression levels best clustering predefined groups of samples.
  The BioMart database is used to obtained Biological Pathway (BP) annotation of
  the genes present in the expression dataset. A one-way ANOVA is performed to
  evaluated the ability of each gene to cluster samples according to the 
  factor under scrutiny. Finally, GO terms are scored by averaging the power
  of their respective gene sets to cluster the samples.
