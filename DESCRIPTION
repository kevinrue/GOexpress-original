Description: The package contains methods to visualise the expression levels
  of genes from a microarray or RNA-seq experiment and offers a clustering
  analysis to identify GO terms enriched in genes with expression levels best
  clustering predefined groups of samples. The BioMart database is used to
  obtain annotation of the genes present in the expression dataset. The random
  forest framework is used to evaluate the ability of each gene to cluster
  samples according to the factor of interest. Finally, GO terms are scored by
  averaging the rank or score of their respective gene sets to cluster the
  samples. An ANOVA approach is also available as an alternative statistical
  framework.
